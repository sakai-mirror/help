        <p>After you have created a portfolio, you may share it with others. You have the option of sharing it with individuals or to groups of people on your site, to individuals outside your site or outside the Sakai environment, or to a URL that can be accessed by anyone via a web browser.</p>
<p>To share a portfolio, access the Portfolio tool and follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the Portfolios home page is not displayed, click the <strong>Reset</strong> button.</li>
<li>Next to the portfolio you are interested in sharing, click <strong>Share</strong> from the Actions drop-down menu. Sakai displays the Share With Others page for that portfolio. Anyone the portfolio has been shared with will be listed.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sharing With Others</strong></p>
<p>On this page, you will decide the specific people or roles you wish to view your portfolio and whether you want to share your portfolio with the public. [Note: Before a portfolio can be viewed by others, you must make sure that it is Active. See Status for instructions. Also, if you are using a template-based portfolio with Required Settings, these settings must be completed. See Required Settings for instructions.]</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the portfolio with designated people or role:<ul>
<li>If you have not yet shared your portfolio with anyone, select <strong>Click here to share with others</strong>. A list of all users in the site is provided. Place a check in the box next to the name of each person you want to share your portfolio. Click <strong>Add Selected Users</strong> to add these users and continue to add other users. Click <strong>Add and Return</strong> to add these users and go back to the list of users you have selected to view your portfolio, or click <strong>Return</strong> if no one has been selected.</li>
<li>If you want to give more people or designated roles access to view the portfolio, click <strong>Add more people/roles</strong>. There are five ways to select additional people. Using the Select by drop-down menu, choose one of the following:<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>browsing for people</strong></em>: This function provides a list of all roles and all users that have access to the site. Click the box next to each person from the site with whom you want to share your portfolio. Click <strong>Add Selected Users</strong> to add these users. You may continue to select other users using other methods via the Select by drop-down menu.

<li>
<em><strong>entering a user id</strong></em>: Enter the User ID of the person you want to see your portfolio. To add additional User IDs click the <strong>Add User</strong> link to the right and enter another valid User ID.

Click <strong>Add and Return</strong> to add these viewers or <strong>Return</strong> if no one has been selected.</li>
<li>

<li>
<em><strong>picking roles related to the site</strong></em>: Select the role(s) of the people you want to view your portfolio (e.g. Reviewer).

Click <strong>Add and Return</strong> to add these users and go back to the list of users you have selected to view your portfolio, or click <strong>Return</strong> if no one has been selected.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>picking roles related to all sites</strong></em>: Select the role(s) of the people you want to view your portfolio (e.g. Reviewer) from the list of all sites you are an active member. Anyone in those sites with the selected role(s) would be able to view your portfolio. Click <strong>Add Selected Roles</strong> to add these viewers and continue adding additional users via the Select by drop-down menu options. Click <strong>Add and Return</strong> to add these users and go back to the list of users you have selected to view your portfolio, or click <strong>Return</strong> if no one has been selected.</li>

This URL can be given to anyone you wish to share your portfolio with via email or another method of communication.
