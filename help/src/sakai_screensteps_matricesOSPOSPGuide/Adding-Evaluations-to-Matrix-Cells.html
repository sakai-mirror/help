        <p>Evaluators can use either the Matrices tool or the Evaluations tool to add an evaluation to a matrix cell. To add an evaluation using the Matrices tool, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the Matrices home page is not displayed, click the <strong>Reset</strong> button.</li>
<li>Find the matrix you want to evaluate and click its name. Sakai displays the selected matrix. In the upper left corner of the screen, a drop-down list of users is displayed. Select the user to whom you wish to give feedback. [Note: If the site contains multiple groups, you may see also a Select group drop-down list. Use this menu to restrict the list of users to a specific group. This can be helpful if the site contains a large number of users).</li>
<li>Sakai displays a read-only copy of the matrix for the user you specified. Verify that you are viewing the correct participant's matrix before proceeding (immediately above the user name drop-down menu, the name of the participant should appear in a message like 'View "PUL Matrix" (READ ONLY): <em>Firstname Lastname</em>'.)</li>
<li>Icons in a cell indicate that the user has attached material to it. Cells color-coded as "Pending" are ready for evaluation.</li>
<li>Click on a pending cell to open it and review its contents.</li>
<li>Click the names of any forms, items, and reflections to open and review them.</li>
<li>In the Evaluations area, click <strong>Add</strong>. Fill in the form according to any instructions given in it. You may be asked to fill in required fields, submit a grade or rating, and add a comment. You may type your comments directly into the text box or copy and paste text from another document.</li>
<li>When you are finished filling in the Evaluation form, click <strong>Save Changes</strong>. To exit without saving your evaluation, click <strong>Cancel</strong>.</li>
<li>After saving your changes, you will be prompted to choose one of the following work flow options:<ul>
<li>Set Status to "<strong>Complete</strong>." Choose this option if no further work is required and the evaluation process is complete. The Items, Reflections, and Evaluations areas of the cell will be locked.</li>
<li>
<strong>No Changes to Status</strong>: Choose this option if you or other evaluators will be adding further evaluations to the cell.</li>
<li>Set Status to "<strong>Ready</strong>." Choose this option to unlock the Evidence and Reflections areas of the cell, so the student can edit, delete, or add attachments, forms, and reflections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose the appropriate radio button, and then click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
<li>You will be returned to the cell in which you were working. Click <strong>Back to the Matrix</strong> to return to the matrix.</li>
</ol>
<p>To add an evaluation using the Evaluations tool, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the Evaluations tool from the left hand Tool Menu. If the home page of the Evaluations tool is not displayed, click the <strong>Reset</strong> button.</li>
<li>The Manage Evaluations screen will display with a list of matrix cells or wizard pages that have been submitted for evaluation. You will only see cells or pages you have permission to evaluate.</li>
<li>Click the title of a cell or page pending evaluation to open it and review its contents.</li>
<li>Click the names of any forms, items, and reflections to open and review them.</li>
<li>In the Evaluations area, click <strong>Add</strong>. Fill in the form according to any instructions given in it. You may be asked to fill in required fields, submit a grade or rating, and add a comment. You may type your comments directly into the text box or copy and paste text from another document.</li>
