<h2>Menubar: Overview</h2>

<p>In your site, the menubar is a customizable column along the left of
the screen that contains links to numerous collaborative tools. Site
leaders have special permissions to add, edit, and delete tools with
Worksite Setup or Site
Info. Therefore, the same tools will not appear in every
site.</p>




<h3>Key concepts</h3>


<p><strong>Adding tools:</strong> A site participant with the
appropriate role can modify the content of the site's menubar by
adding or subtracting tools using the Site Info tool.</p>

<p>The site owner can choose to display (or hide) the following tools
in the menubar:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Home:</strong> This is the
course or project site homepage. Home can contain a list of
recent announcements, discussion items, and chat messages. 

<br /><br /> 
</li><li><strong>Announcements:</strong> Post current, time-critical
information (e.g., to inform users of changes in the schedule or
policies of the class).

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Assignments:</strong> Post, submit, and grade online
assignments. Your participants can submit assignments electronically
for grading and comments.

<br /><br /> </li><li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Post and view deadlines and
events (e.g., class session dates, assignments dates, and
cancellations).

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Chat Room:</strong> Hold real-time written discussions
with other site participants. Chat is faster and more convenient than
waiting for participants to post in the discussion area.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Post asynchronous conversations by
topic or category.

<br /><br /> 
</li><li><strong>Drop Box:</strong> Create areas for private file sharing
between site leaders and participants.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Email Archive:</strong> View email sent to the site.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Gradebook:</strong> Calculate, store, and present grades.
<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Message Center:</strong> Create discussion forums and add
private messaging to your site.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>News:</strong> Link to RSS newsfeeds.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Podcasts:</strong> Manage individual podcasts and podcast
feed information.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Post'Em:</strong> Upload and share <code>.csv</code> files to
display feedback (e.g., grades and comments) to site participants.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Presentation:</strong>
Present a slide show of images to many viewers at once, or have them
step through the show on their own.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Resources:</strong> Upload, store, and share files and
URLs.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Roster:</strong> View the list of site participants.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Syllabus:</strong> Create and display a
course syllabus, or have it point to a pre-existing online syllabus.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Tests and Quizzes:</strong>
Create and deliver tests and surveys.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Web Content:</strong> Add web page links to the menubar.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Wiki:</strong> Collaborate with other participants to
create and maintain web pages.
</li></ul>

<p>Site Info displays information
about the site for site participants. Site leaders can use this tool
to add participants, edit tools, manage groups, and import files. This
tool is part of every site, and cannot be deleted from the
menubar.</p>




<p>The Help tool has support documentation for all the tools, and can
contain links to other support resources. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Your system administrator controls which
tools are available on your system. When new tools become available,
or users' needs change, your system administrator can add tools to the
system, and then they will appear in the list of tools that you can
add to your site.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>If your system allows it, create a practice site so that site
participants can familiarize themselves with the tools, functions, and
options.<br /><br />
</li><li>To avoid the accidental loss of resources, assign roles wisely.
Assign roles with broad permissions only to co-instructors and others
whom you can trust to edit your site. Everyone else should get a more
restricted role, allowing access but not site manipulation. For
instance, if another participant removes the Syllabus tool from your
site, it will irreversibly remove the syllabus information that you
stored there.
</li></ul>
