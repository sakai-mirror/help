<h2>Preferences: Overview</h2>
<h3>What they do</h3>

<p>
In <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>, you can set Preferences for how and how
often you receive email notification of worksite activity, such as
Email Archive messages, Announcements, and added Resources. You can
also choose the worksites for which you'd like to see tabs.
</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3> 

<p><strong>Notification methods:</strong> You may choose from several
notification methods for Announcement activity, Email Archive
messages, Resource activity, and Syllabus activity:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Receive individually when posted:</strong> You receive
email notification each time that an Announcement is posted, a
Resource is added, or email is sent.
<br /><br />

</li><li><strong>Daily digest:</strong> Individual Announcements,
Resources, Syllabus activity, and/or mail messages are bundled into a single email
message and sent to you daily. 

<br /><br /> 

</li><li><strong>Block:</strong> You receive no notification regarding low
priority site activity.
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Customize Tabs:</strong> By default, you will see a tab for
each site to which you belong. If you wish to change which tabs are
visible, click <strong><code>Customize Tabs</code></strong> and select the tabs for which
you'd like to change the visibility.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>You cannot have different Preferences for individual
worksites. For example, if you change your Email Archive notification
to "daily digest", you will get a daily email message from each of the
sites to which you belong. Or, if you choose to block Announcements,
notifications about low priority announcements will be blocked for all
sites to which you belong.

<br /><br />
</li><li>High priority notifications cannot be blocked. If you send a high
priority notification, it is delivered immediately to all of your
site's participants.
</li></ul>
