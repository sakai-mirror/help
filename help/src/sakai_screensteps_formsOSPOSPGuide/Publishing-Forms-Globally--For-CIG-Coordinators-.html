        <p><strong>Requesting Global Publication of a Form</strong></p>
<p>If you have created a form that has general applicability, you may want to make it available for use in all sites. However, only Sakai system administrator(s) can publish a form globally (that is, across all sites in Sakai), so you must send the administrator a request.</p>
<p>To request that a form be published globally, access the Forms tool and follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. If the Manage Forms page is not displayed, click the <strong>Reset</strong> button.<br> 2. On the Manage Forms page, find the form you want to submit to the system administrator for global publication.<br> 3. Click <strong>Publish Global</strong> for the form. Sakai displays the Publish Form confirmation screen.<br> 4. To proceed with the request, click <strong>Yes</strong>. Sakai displays the Manage Forms page. The Global State for this form is changed to "waiting for approval."&nbsp; Or, to return to the Manage Forms page without submitting the request, click <strong>No</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Publishing a Form Globally</strong></p>
<p>If you are a system administrator, you may publish a form globally (that is, for all sites in a Sakai instance). To do so, log in and follow these steps:<br> 1. Go to the Portfolio Admin site.<br> 3. Access the Forms tool. Sakai displays the Manage Forms&nbsp; page.<br> 4. Find the form you want to publish globally and click <strong>Approve Global Publish</strong> link beneath its name. Sakai displays the Publish Form confirmation screen.<br> 5. To proceed with the request, click <strong>Yes</strong>. Sakai displays the Manage Forms page. Or, to return to the Manage Forms page without submitting the request, click <strong>No</strong>.<br> 6. The form is now available for use in all sites.</p>
