        <p><strong>Requesting Global Publication of a Style<br></strong></p>
<p>If you have created a style that has general applicability, you may want to make it available for use in all sites in your instance of Sakai. However, only Sakai system administrator(s) can publish a style globally (that is, across all sites in Sakai).</p>
<p>To request that a style be published globally, access the Styles tool and follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. If the Styles home page is not displayed, click the <strong>Reset</strong> button.<br> 2. Find the style you want to suggest for global publication.<br> 3. Click the <strong>Suggest for global publish</strong> link below the name of the style. Sakai submits the style for consideration for global publication and displays the Styles home page again.</p>
<p><strong>Publishing a Style Globally</strong></p>
<p>If you are a system administrator, you may publish a style globally (that is, for all sites in a Sakai instance). To do so, log in and follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Select the Portfolio Admin site.<br> 2. Access the Styles tool. Sakai displays the Styles home page.<br> 3. Find the style you want to publish and click the <strong>Publish</strong> link beneath its name. Sakai makes the style available to all sites.</p>
<p>[Note: If you delete a style that has been suggested for global publishing from the Portfolio Admin site, you will also delete the style from the site in which it was created.]</p>
